# sailsapp

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

just hit cd into the directory with app.js file and hit  -- sails lift
or -- node app.js

# this are the api's

GET /api/orders
'GET /api/process/:id?'

 'POST /api/process/:id'


#this is an extra api to load the data

  this api calls load the data from a file in the seeds folder orders.json and processing.json
  into Mongodb database on defualt mongodb port

   'POST /api/loadorders'
   'POST /api/loadprocessing'


   #WANNING
  the database is droped on application restart so if the application is restarted all data would be deleted
  so you would have to load it using the api or from the browser using the LoadDatafirst button

#Thanks
I'm very happy that you people have giving me a chance for an interview.
working with intelligent developers has been one of my dreams. and my skills
are not so much but I must say that this task has made me fall in love with sails.js.
backbone was a bit hard for me but I know with time I will adapt to it to meet your
companies needs when given the chance.
#I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TO LOOK AT MY WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONCE AGAIN
